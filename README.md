# Tic Tac Toe implemented with React

This is an implementation of the clasic Tic Tac Toe game based on [the official tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

**The major difference is that my implementation uses the newly introduced [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html) to manage state instead of using class components.**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
